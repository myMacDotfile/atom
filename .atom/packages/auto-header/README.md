Auto Header
===

Fast generate the header content of your project files!

Usage
---

`auto-header: generate` will change the header comment of current file

the default text is like this

```
# Copyright (c) 2015 by your name. All Rights Reserved.
```

to change the template this plugin generated, you can change the `auto-header.template` config.
Multi-line templates are not supported in current atom version, so you have to change it in `config.cson`, like

```cson
'*':
  'auto-header':
    'template': '''
      Copyright (c) {{year}} by {{author}}.
      All Rights Reserved.

      {{license-header}}
    '''
```

### {{year}}
will be replaced by current year

### {{author}}
will be replaced by `auto-header.author` config

### {{license-header}}
