# Open in CMD

![snapshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmatt-bit/atom_open_in_cmd/master/screenshot.gif)

Thanks to ziyasal's [open-conemu-here](https://github.com/ziyasal/atom-open-conemu-here), I can create "open_in_cmd" package. With "open_in_cmd", User can open a CMD in Atom directly from tree-view & editor.  

To install package from command line:
```shell
apm install open_in_cmd
```

Note: This package is only enabled on Windows, that's why "CMD" is used.
